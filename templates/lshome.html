    <h1>So... What is <span id="sp">SAVINGS PLAN?</span></h1>
<hr>
    <br>
    A savings plan is a financial product tha
    t you buy to grow your savings over a fixed period of time. A savings account, on the other hand, is a bank account where you keep excess money that you have. <span id="sp">So donâ€™t confuse it with saving account!</span><br><br>
Unlike a savings account, where you can withdraw at your discretion, a savings plan is more structured and requires you to commit to the plan that you bought for a fixed timeframe.

    <br><br>The sooner you start saving, and the more often you save, the better. Time works to your advantage, which is why <span id="sp">START NOW!</span>
